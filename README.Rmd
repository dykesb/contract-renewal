## Introduction

I aim to empower others to do "cool things".
As a faculty member in the Department of Statistics, this means that I get to do so by providing space where others can explore their interests, sharing my interests, and showing how Statistics can strengthen others' contributions to their own field and society.
In this statement, I will describe how I am progressing towards meeting the standards for effective teaching, scholarly/creative activity, and service for tenure and promotion.

Please note that I was granted one year towards tenure when I was hired into this position in 2018.
Therefore, I will refer to relevant activities from my time at Husson University within the College Science and Humanities.

## Teaching

I love to go hiking with my Great Dane, Odin.
Over the years we have discovered that he is exceptionally talented at scaling up steep inclines despite his long, awkward frame.
One of my favorite times that we went hiking was in Maine.
We had spent all morning gradually making up it up Bernard Mountain in Acadia National Park and on our descent, we came to a what seemed like a six-foot drop.
Despite his best attempt and my coaxing, he had met his match.
It was simply too large of a drop for him so we headed back the way we came.
Despite extending our hike duration substantially, I was still so impressed by the climbing that he had already done.
In teaching, I view myself as a trail guide where students and I are on this path of learning together.
*Make connection to classroom instruction (I know where we need to go, but I can be somewhat flexible in the path that we take), individual mentoring, and advising (encourage students to take safe risks, but be ready to find an alternate path).*
I believe that a thoughtful and intentional plan of where we are going as helps to provide clarity for the students and myself as we progress along the path.

When I started my tenure-track position at GVSU, I was fortunate to have been assigned three sections of STA 216 (a second course in statistics).
I had never taught this material before and was not sure of a best path to take, but I received many valuable resources from colleagues.
Dr. John Gabrosek shared his materials along with his reflections on what went well and what he would improve with Dr. Neal Rogness and I.
Together, Dr. Rogness and I continued developing Dr. Gabrosek's team-based learning (TBL - flipped classroom experience that I will expand upon shortly) materials and assignments.
*Talk about collaborative lesson planning ideas from [The Carpentries](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/) and [Teach Tech Together](http://teachtogether.tech/#s:process-maintainability) - building upon practices of experienced educators*
I have not yet practiced this level of collaborative design in other courses that I have taught at GVSU, but my colleagues have always been more than willing to share their materials and reflections for which I am extremely grateful.

Collaboratively designing STA 216 really helped me to become more aware of how to deconstruct the goals of a lesson and check questions or items for clarity.
As I continue to research ways to design active learning materials and how to ask questions to facilitate different levels of thinking (*awkward - rework*), I became more aware of my blind-spots (i.e., terms, processes, or statements that I use because I have a different level of experience with the content than students).
*For example, I have a lot of experience working with computers and programming languages to handle data wrangling, but while many students are simply trying to understand the terminology and notation that I am using.*
Student commented during the the Fall 2018 semester and afterwards in the course evaluations that they had trepidation with learning SAS (a statistical analysis software suite) for a variety of reasons.
These student's comments paired with my own desire to integrate SAS more throughout the course led me to create materials that introduced some SAS basics (e.g., data filtering, numerical summaries, and data visualizations) to use early in the Winter 2019 semester and continue to build on these throughout the semester (*link STA 216 Activities*).

While the relative number of comments critiquing SAS decreased on student evaluations in the Winter 2019 semester, assessment questions still had a high number of fully or partially incorrect responses (*get numbers from past exams if I still have - item analysis has 90.7% of students missing points on Exam 1 Quesion 21.*)
I felt that I went too far the other direction - introducing too much SAS too early.
During the Winter 2019 semester I was introduced to the idea of a minimal manual (i.e., only showing enough detail so that students can complete the needed task, but providing suggestions or resources for further exploration) from communications with Dr. Mark Guzdial of the University of Michigan's School of Information.
With instructing SAS to produce various statistical results, I can see how it is confusing to students especially after their last experience with a statistical analysis tool was through the point-and-click interface of SPSS.
With my next opportunity teaching STA 216, I focused students attention on values that change and values that stay the same in a SAS code chunk.
For example, to calculate the summary statistics for a `variable` within some `dataset` we could use the SAS code chunk on the left in Figure `\ref{fig:generic-sas}`.
I spent time in class highlighting the portions of code that changed by drawing code that I projected on the whiteboard like shown on the right.
After we finished an activity, I then randomly assigned a group of students to be responsible for adding any new code that we covered to a shared Google Document (*link to Google doc*).


```{r sas-means, fig.height=1.5, fig.show = "hold", fig.align = "default", fig.cap="\\label{fig:generic-sas}SAS code comparison with generic code (left) and fill-in-blank code (right)"}

p1 <- ggdraw() + 
  draw_image(here::here("images","generic-sas.png")) +
  theme(panel.border = element_rect(colour = "black", fill = NA, size = 2))
p2 <- ggdraw() + 
  draw_image(here::here("images","generic-sas-blanks.png"))+
  theme(panel.border = element_rect(colour = "black", fill = NA, size = 2))

plot_grid(p1, p2)
# knitr::include_graphics(c(here::here("images","generic-sas.png"), 
#                         here::here("images","generic-sas-blanks.png")))
```

These fill-in-the-blank coding exercises great because you can make them more difficult by removing additional components to while assessing the different components of the syntax (e.g., remove all function/procedure terms).
During the second half of the Winter 2020 semester (the transition to remote instruction), I also learned that Blackboard has a fill-in-the-blank question type that you can replicate these type of quick assessment questions.
*I plan to integrate these questions earlier in STA 216 this coming semester and will directly ask students how they like them during my midterm evaluation*

*I have since learned, through the Pew FTLC Inclusive Excellence Teaching Institute, that transparency in instruction and directions can help set all students up for success, not just those that feel comfortable enough to ask for clarification.*
*I want students to feel that they can come and ask me questions, but I cannot force them to - I can, however, adapt my materials to be more comprehensive.*

I took part in a Faculty Learning Community facilitated by Drs. Gabrosek and Rogness on Team-Based Learning (TBL) while I was a visiting professor at GVSU.
TBL is a type of flipped classroom experience where students do readings and other preparatory work prior to class meetings, take an in-class quiz over the foundational knowledge they were asked to prepare, and then class time is spend working on activities that extend their foundational understanding.
Students are placed into semester long teams for where they work with each other to complete a team quiz and the in-class activities.
This approach felt like a natural progression from my guided notes to me taking more of a trail guide role in students' learning.
Sometimes, students need time to go explore  on their own with a planned time to reconvene and share their findings.

*Discuss students' feelings of "self teaching" - I need to include provide a better discussion at the start of the semester and intentionally remind students of my reasoning throughout the semester explaining why I am using a flipped classroom*
*My reasons include ...*



****

- I haven't been able to get students as excited when I put on my "teaching boots" as Odin when he sees me reach for my hiking boots.
However, something something I bring a level of excitement and energy to the course something something.

- In assisting students to explore their own interests, I hope to also show how Statistics can strengthen their contributions to their field and society.

- I tell my students that it took me several changes in major (five to be exact) to determine a field where I truly felt at home. 

- I joke with students in the STA 215 sections that I teach that while it would be great if all of them decided to pick up a minor in statistics, I know that what is interesting to me might very well be uninteresting to them. However, I ask that they approach the content with an open mind and willingness to work and grow so that they leave with a better appreciation of how statistics can be useful for them.


- In graduate school while I was a teaching assistant and later a faculty specialist charged with coordinating one of our introductory statistics courses, consistency of material and examinations across multiple sections was vital as many of us had very limited teaching experience. Consistent lecture slides and automatically graded homework assignments and exams helped me to focus on becoming more comfortable talking in front of people and build connections with students, but it also afford me time to develop clarifying activities (*examples of STAT2160 slides/homework*?). At times, these lecture slides/homework seemed too mechanical to me.
- While an assistant professor at Husson University, I began to transition away from lecture-driven material delivery to using guided/active lecture notes (*examples of MS132 activities*). I wanted to become more of a trail guide to students rather than the *keeper of knowledge* - I didn't have all the answers and I could help them figure it out. I read the revised 2005 GAISE report[^GAISE2005] in graduate school and was trying to integrate the six recommendations to the best of my ability (though, admittedly, focusing two of these recommendations: using real data and fostering active learning).

[^GAISE2005]: Aliaga, M., Cobb, G., Cuff, C., Garfield, J., Gould, R., Lock, R., Moore, T., Rossman, A., Stephenson, B., Utts, J., Velleman, P., Witmer, J. (2005). Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education (GAISE) College Report. American Statistical Association. Online at: https://www.amstat.org/asa/files/pdfs/GAISE/2005GaiseCollege_Full.pdf



- Transition to mastery-based (or specification or standards-based) grading (**define**) has allowed me to maintain high standards and gives students multiple opportunities to achieve the level of mastery that they are seeking. Like a traditional grading system, students are presented with overall course learning objectives. However, in a mastery-based grading system, each assessment tasks also has clearly labeled learning objectives attached to it. In these assessments, students receive substantial feedback and an indication of where they are currently (e.g., I use a rubric for each task in my [STA 418/518 grading policy](https://sta518.github.io/courses/assessment/grading/)). Unlike most traditional grading systems, students are then provided with opportunities to revise and resubmit most assessment tasks sometimes requiring students to submit additional materials like additional task items or a reflection on how the feedback aided their understanding (e.g., [STA 418/518 revision and reassement policy](https://sta518.github.io/courses/assessment/revision/)). 
- One of my departmental mentors, Dr. John Gabrosek, introduced me to Dr. John Golden from the Department of Mathematics to discuss how he does various creative activities. After our initial conversation, I invited Dr. Golden and his colleagues that also use a mastery-based grading system (i.e., Drs. David Clark, Jon Hasenbank, Lauren Keough, and Taylor Short) to hold a panel discussion with our department (*include shared google doc from this discussion?*).

- Encourage students to explore on their own. Recently I have realized that many may have never wanted to do this or had experience with self-exploration, so they need additional guidance along this process.
- How can we help students to become self-motivated?
- I am trying to be more intentional in the directions provided to students so details are presented in a concise, clear way; being cautious of the jargon I use and aware of my own blind-spots.

- Flipped-style classroom where I provide students with readings, tutorials, videos to complete outside of class. Class time is then spent working on activities (frequently in groups) or working on extending their abilities with application tasks. Sometimes these applictions have a "choose your own adventure" qualtity where students can pick a couple of items from a larger list to complete (e.g., STA 418/518). I like the ability to "roam" the classroom and work on a more personal level with groups of students and doing full class discussions/lectures when needed to clarify confusing concepts. Using materials developed by Drs. Gabrosek and Rogness in STA 215 and STA 216 have immensly aided in this process.

- Give example of STA 418/518 module prep
  - Outcomes
  - Concept map
  - Readings/tutorials
  - Activity
  - Application
  - Project

Developed activities can sometime reduce the flexibility of and improvisation of a lecture-based classroom; however, clarifying lectures or discussion can still be sprinkled throughout to fit the class' needs.

In our transition to remote and online learning during the second half of  Winter 2020 and more specifically Spring/Summer 2020, I began using scheduled classtime as more of a live demonstration rather than working on activities where students could add items to my agenda that they wanted me to have prepared up to a couple of hours prior to class time. They could still ask questions live if new ones arose or they did not have the opportunity to add items before I closed that day's agenda (**refer to examples on GitHub**). These sessions were recorded so students that were not able to actively participate could still view the session.

Agenda/reminders

Directions (especially on at-home assignments) have become more detailed

Organized Bb course site. This isn't always the most evident to me and I ask for student feedback as the semester progresses. Responsive to needs of students and use verbal feedback to adapt Bb.

Midterm evaluation process. How is this evolving? How do I use this and share with students? (*Show process of Google Form > RMarkdown > Report*)

Peer Feedback forms (*Show process*). How is this evolving? How can I get more student involvement in their evaluations? Could be a learning journal entry.

Students' learning journals on GitHub. Can give additional feedback or reinforce their understanding (*show anonymized examples from Spring 2020 STA 418/518*)

Themes from LIFT evaluations. Do I still have my evaluations from Husson?

Colors are consistent from between bump plots below. However, these colors are simply used to help make changes across sections more clear.
Items that were repeatedly lower in rank are shaded darker in color.
Overall, students' seem to feel that I am *at least* "good" in these formative items, but there are some places that I have tried to improve based on their ratings and comments.

In lower-division courses, I need to do a better job of making the course content more relevant to students.
One thing I do differently in the upper-division courses it to incorporate more of project-based assessments (even in smaller homework assignments).
Students regardless of course level appear to notice my enthusiasm for the material and I might be able to better use this trait to help students in these lower-division course see the relevance of the material.
For example, I could do a better job setting up activities to help students.

- How can I make STA 215 material seem more relevant/useful? 
  Would like to include time to have students work on a project, but would need to think of what material could be re-positioned.
  Would allow for students/teams to be able to express themselves if this is student-driven.

STA 216 was my first experience teaching an entire course using TBL.
It seems that my own uncomfortableness with how to organize a TBL class was very apparent to the students and this frustrated a number of them.

There were some comments about being more clear about requirements/expectations or when answering questions.
I'm still working on how to get better at providing hints or suggestions to questions without simply giving students the right answer.
Something I do that adds to students confusion is using terminology or jargon that students still  might not fully understand.
(**point to sta216 take home exam from winter 2020 at an attempt for more clarity**)
(**point to sta418/518 activities at attempt to scaffold tasks using consistent terminology**)

During my mid-semester student feedback consultation with Dr. Christine Rener, we discussed ways to let students know that I was in fact helping them learn through TBL by providing a lot of directions and details in the reading and activity directions.
We also discussed ways that I could make the clarifying mini-lectures stand out more by announcing that I was going to write something on the board to provide students time to mentally and physically switch over to taking notes.

After this Fall 2018 semester, I began to focus students' attention to the reading objectives that I provided them for their assigned readings and the activity outcomes that were provided at the end of documents.

Throughout the semester, a number of students expressed a desire for me to provide them with individual copies of the activities during class.
I did my best to express my intention for providing each team with only a few copies (e.g., to help facilitate discussion between team members) and that they always had access to the files on the Blackboard course site.
After the Fall 2018 semester I switched to using Google Docs for sharing activities.
Part of the discussions that we have while I walk around the classroom with t

There are number of comments about "self-teaching".
While I don't necessarily view this as a criticism of me or TBL, I understand why students think this frustrating and do not intend it to be a complement.
Talking with students early in the semester about how they might feel that they are "only" self-teaching during the semester, but let them know of the different supports they have (e.g., me in class, me during student hours, peers during class, and the tutoring center).
(**Need to make my guiding more evident to students and perhaps be more explicit in my syllabus/first week**)
(**Consider adding brief discussions to classes asking students how they prepare for class - say, prep check ins**)
In my summer STA 418/518 I am doing live demonstrations where I work through similar tasks on a new dataset.
I would like to create many shorter videos for students to refer to while they work through the material and have started to concept map topics (**upload example**).

From my RStudio Instructor training, I've learned that live coding is very beneficial for students to not only see correct ways of solving problems, but that mistakes are ok and that even I make mistakes.
When I make a mistake provides an opportunity for me to explain how I know it is a mistake and what I can do to fix it.

- There is a lot of restructuring that I would like to do with STA 321 and this was my first attempt at implementing a revision/submission policy which students seemed to appreciate.
  Comments on pace - this semester had the snow week and I took over it during the second week.
  I felt very scattered and often felt like I was only a couple of hours ahead of the students.
  Eventually I was able to get more prepared, but I tried to be very flexible with students.

I really enjoy this course and there is a lot I can still do to improve it.
I relied too much on the activities the first time teaching this course.

Developing preferred teaching style: flipped (readings, videos, tutorials expected to be completed outside of class), short live demos from me scattered throughout a team activity, individual applications that reinforce and extend the activities, projects that reinforce and extend many topics.
Heavily inspired by reading Wilson (2019)[^Wilson2019], Ambrose et al. (2010)[^Ambrose2010], and my RStudio Instructor certification course.

## Service

Work at Husson

- Developed Data Analytics undergraduate program and certificate. The underlying them for this program was to give students a solid foundation in understanding, explore, and modeling data; having students extend this foundation with more advanced concepts in computing, mathematics, or statistics; apply their skills in a domain outside of computing, mathematics, or statistics; and learning multiple ways to communicate information effectively.
- For this program, I developed DA 210 Introduction to Data Analytics, DA 310 Data Visualization (now DA 110 Data Exploration and Visualization), DA 420 Data Analytics Seminar, DA 449 Data Analytics Internship (now DA 499 Data Analytics Internship), DA 489 Data Analytics Capstone, MS 212 Intermediate Applied Statistics, and MS 332 Statistical Modeling (now MS 333 Statistical Modeling). Aided in the redevelopment of MS 181 Calculus I, MS 182 Calculus II, and MS 241 Linear Algebra with Applications.
- In preparing this program and certificate I also developed MS 132 Probability and Statistics, DA 210, and DA 310 for online 7-week delivery.
- Involved a lot of networking, traveling to local highschoolers to promote Husson and the program, traveled to a weekend high school math competition to promote program, connected with existing programs on campus to see how the DA certificate could pair with their courses load and what courses they currently offered that could satisfy domain area electives.
- Search committee member for DA new-hire and student experience coordinator.
