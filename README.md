Contract Renewal Statement
================

## Introduction

  - I was granted one year towards tenure when I was hired in 2018. I
    will refer to relevant activities and achievements from my time at
    Husson University within the College Science and Humanities.

Empowering others to do “cool things”

  - Teaching
      - Help others find what does or does not interest them
  - Scholarly activity
      - How I find my interest
  - Service
      - Provide/create spaces where others can explore their interests

## Teaching

  - Transition to master-based grading (**define**) has allowed me to
    maintain high standards and gives students multiple opportunities to
    achieve the level of mastery that they are seeking.
  - Encourage students to explore on their own. Recently I have realized
    that many may have never wanted to do this or had experience with
    self-exploration, so they need additional guidance along this
    process.
  - How can we help students to become self-motivated?
  - I am trying to be more intentional in the directions provided to
    students so details are presented in a concise, clear way; being
    cautious of the jargon I use and aware of my own blind-spots.

Work at Husson - Taught 4/4 load along with one online 7-week course
after developing during the first 7-weeks. Online courses were overload.

### Classroom management skills

  - Flipped-style classroom where I provide students with readings,
    tutorials, videos to complete outside of class. Class time is then
    spent working on activities (frequently in groups) or working on
    extending their abilities with application tasks. Sometimes these
    applictions have a “choose your own adventure” qualtity where
    students can pick a couple of items from a larger list to complete
    (e.g., STA 418/518). I like the ability to “roam” the classroom and
    work on a more personal level with groups of students and doing full
    class discussions/lectures when needed to clarify confusing
    concepts. Using materials developed by Drs. Gabrosek and Rogness in
    STA 215 and STA 216 have immensly aided in this process.

### Preparation and organization

  - Give example of STA 418/518 module prep
      - Outcomes
      - Concept map
      - Readings/tutorials
      - Activity
      - Application
      - Project

Developed activities can sometime reduce the flexibility of and
improvisation of a lecture-based classroom; however, clarifying lectures
or discussion can still be sprinkled throughout to fit the class’ needs.

In our transition to remote and online learning during the second half
of Winter 2020 and more specifically Spring/Summer 2020, I began using
scheduled classtime as more of a live demonstration rather than working
on activities where students could add items to my agenda that they
wanted me to have prepared up to a couple of hours prior to class time.
They could still ask questions live if new ones arose or they did not
have the opportunity to add items before I closed that day’s agenda
(**refer to examples on GitHub**). These sessions were recorded so
students that were not able to actively participate could still view the
session.

### Communication

Agenda/reminders

Directions (especially on at-home assignments) have become more detailed

Organized Bb course site. This isn’t always the most evident to me and I
ask for student feedback as the semester progresses.

### Enthusiasm

### Knowledge

### Evaluation

Mixture of set due dates and revisions/resubmits

### Availability

### Intellectual motivation

### Flexibility and resourcefulness in teaching

### Dedication to students

## Scholarly activity

  - Working with students on scholarly activity… I am working on
    developing a general “syllabus” or “contract” to share with students
    that are interested in working together on projects so that we have
    clear expectations of each other.
  - List ongoing projects and specific areas that students can work with
    me on my personal site.
  - Learning how to prioritize scholarly activities and when to
    encourage people to reach out to colleagues.

Work at Husson - Consulting work with Dr. Jay Polsgrove - Institutional
research assistance

### Activities expected each year

### Activities expected periodically

### Activities that represent areas of significant focus

## Service

Work at Husson

  - Developed Data Analytics undergraduate program and certificate. The
    underlying them for this program was to give students a solid
    foundation in understanding, explore, and modeling data; having
    students extend this foundation with more advanced concepts in
    computing, mathematics, or statistics; apply their skills in a
    domain outside of computing, mathematics, or statistics; and
    learning multiple ways to communicate information effectively.
  - For this program, I developed DA 210 Introduction to Data Analytics,
    DA 310 Data Visualization (now DA 110 Data Exploration and
    Visualization), DA 420 Data Analytics Seminar, DA 449 Data Analytics
    Internship (now DA 499 Data Analytics Internship), DA 489 Data
    Analytics Capstone, MS 212 Intermediate Applied Statistics, and MS
    332 Statistical Modeling (now MS 333 Statistical Modeling). Aided in
    the redevelopment of MS 181 Calculus I, MS 182 Calculus II, and MS
    241 Linear Algebra with Applications.
  - In preparing this program and certificate I also developed MS 132
    Probability and Statistics, DA 210, and DA 310 for online 7-week
    delivery.
  - Involved a lot of networking, traveling to local highschoolers to
    promote Husson and the program, traveled to a weekend high school
    math competition to promote program, connected with existing
    programs on campus to see how the DA certificate could pair with
    their courses load and what courses they currently offered that
    could satisfy domain area electives.
  - Search committee member for DA new-hire and student experience
    coordinator.
